					LUCIFER'S ENSEMBLE is a music performance project crossing physical theatre, interactive technologies and sound art. 

					An inverted triangle comprising two performers 
					(from collective DEMO) and a musician/composer (from Digitópia — Casa da Música and Sonoscopia). In their music performances they usually include guest musicians to close the circle of conceptual pieces dedicated to themes of the occult. 

					Such themes evolve mostly around notions such as those of Ritual, Trance and Transcendence; The Night, the Morning Star and the Angel of Light; The Fool's Journey and the Wishful Fall, among others.

					Lucifer’s Ensemble creative process has been developed since the beginning in a residency format (ex: Sonoscopia - Oporto, Zaratan - Lisbon, among others) taking full advantage of presentation spaces, exploring its acoustical properties and adapting a site-specific performance. 

					Lucifer’s Ensemble have performed in several festivals such as Festival Forte - Art Attack Stage and Jardins Efémeros where they were invited by The Wire - Off The Page for a talk with Joseph Stannard (Deputy Editor of The Wire and founder of The Outer Church) for a group discussion about the occult, ritual practice and the ways in which certain magically charged conditions can impact upon our perception of time. 

					Violeta Lisboa and Nuno Marques Pinto have been participating with Lucifer’s Ensemble since the project  The Occult Room realized in Jardins Efémeros festival (2016). They integrated the Wishfull Fall tour and participated in the studio recordings of Lucifer’s Ensemble first edition - Alpha.
