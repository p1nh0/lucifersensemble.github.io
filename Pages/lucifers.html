					LUCIFER'S ENSEMBLE is a music performance project crossing physical theatre, interactive technologies and sound art. An inverted triangle comprising two performers and a musician/composer. 
					<br><br>
					In their music performances they usually include guest musicians to close the circle of conceptual pieces dedicated to matters of the occult.
					<br><br>
					Such matters evolve mostly around notions of Ritual, Trance and Transcendence, The Night, The Morning Star and The Angel of Light, The Fool's Journey and The Wishful Fall...... ...... ......
					<br><br>
					Lucifer's Ensemble creative process has been developed in residency formats (at Sonoscopia - Oporto, Zaratan - Lisbon, among others) taking advantage of presentation spaces, exploring its acoustical properties and adapting a site-specific performance.
					<br><br>
					Lucifer's Ensemble have performed in several festivals such as Festival Forte - Art Attack Stage and Jardins Ef&eacutemeros where they were invited by The Wire - Off The Page for a group discussion about the occult, ritual practice and the ways in which certain magically charged conditions can impact upon our perception of time.
					<br><br>
					After the Wishfull Fall tour (2016) they released their first edition - Alpha, in 2017.
